# Spray+

This script is **fully server-side** and support server **only after June 2022** version (due to `GetPlayerInfo` become shared).  
It is based on the standard spray system of the game so ***there is no point in using it if you have an addon that replaces the spray mechanism with a custom one (like DSprays)***.
